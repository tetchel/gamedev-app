Bugs: 
- Rotating quickly (or in one direction?) moves crosshair away from player's rotation!!

- ThirdPersonShooterCam should be bound to the player, not to the camera
- Camera/crosshair logic should be decoupled from aiming (for the computer player)

App 3
- Y-axis aiming
- Crouch/Jump/Sprint
- Better environment
- SFX/Music
- Fix camera being blocked by stuff in the foreground
